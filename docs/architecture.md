# Timbre Architecture

## Overview
Timbre is a modern C++ application designed for high performance and reliability. It uses a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

    end
```

## Key Components

### Build System
- CMake-based build system
- Multi-architecture support (x86_64, arm64)
- Integrated static analysis
- Automated testing with Catch2
- Version management system

### Core Components
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface using CLI11
- **Config Manager**: TOML-based configuration system
- **Core Engine**: Main application logic
- **Logger**: Asynchronous logging system
- **Version System**: Semantic versioning with dev/release management
